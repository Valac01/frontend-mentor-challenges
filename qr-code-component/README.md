## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I tried to follow BEM convention, and written my class names to match the convention. 

```html
<div class="card">
  <img class="card__image">
  <h1 class="card__title">...</h1>
  <p class="card__content">...</p>
</div>
```

### Continued development

In future projects I want to use more relative units, and BEM naming conventions.
